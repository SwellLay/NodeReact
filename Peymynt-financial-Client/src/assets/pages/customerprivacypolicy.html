Peymynt - Customer Privacy Policy

We are Peymynt Financial Inc. (“Peymynt”), and we value your trust and respect your privacy.

Payments by Peymynt is an invoicing platform for businesses. If you do not wish to receive your invoices through our
platform, or if you notice any inaccuracies in your billing or payment information, you should contact the Peymynt user
who sent you the invoice directly to let them know.

In order to provide our payments service, Peymynt and our service providers will collect, use, disclose or otherwise
manage certain limited information about you or your business, including your name, the name of your company, billing
address, invoice date and amount, and payment information. If you wish to make payments directly from a bank account,
you will be asked to provide your account credentials (including username or account number and password). We will
access your account to retrieve certain account information, including your account balance.

Peymynt may collect, use, store, or disclose this information:

To process your payment of invoices, including tracking your payment to let your business partners (our users) know when
their invoices have been paid when any amounts due have settled in their accounts;
To provide you or business partner the option of storing your payment information for later or recurring use;
To help better understand how our customers interact with our user interfaces and Services; and
To comply with any laws, regulations, court orders, subpoenas or other legal processes or investigations, including to
comply with anti-money laundering laws and other laws and rules that apply to us and to our service providers, and to
protect ourselves and other individuals from harm.

We will never sell this information to third parties, and will only retain this information for the period necessary to
fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law or regulation.

We use service providers to process payments made through Payments by Peymynt. If you make a payment from your bank
account, please note that:

Peymynt uses Plaid Inc. (“Plaid”) to gather your data from financial institutions. By using our service, you grant
Peymynt and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and
financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information
being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with the Plaid Privacy Policy.

In general, our service providers may maintain and process your information in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. In the
event information is transferred to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdiction, it will be subject to the laws of that
jurisdiction and may be disclosed to or accessed by the courts, law enforcement and governmental authorities in
accordance with those laws. This information will only be used for the purposes described in this policy.
