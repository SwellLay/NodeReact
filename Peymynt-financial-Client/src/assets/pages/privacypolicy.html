                            data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.peymynt.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1556743010962000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBPBU70FY_LDEO6clPA8Itn9KKjw">www.peymynt.com</a>&nbsp;and,
                        its subdomains (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), and our mobile apps, all of which are owned and
                        operated by Peymynt Financial Inc. It does not apply to any third-party websites, which
                        have their own policies. Throughout this policy, when we say Peymynt, we mean our
                        company, including the Site and any Peymynt mobile apps, and when we say Services we
                        mean the various financial products and services, and apps we make available to you
                        through our Site and mobile apps, including our payments, payroll, accounting, invoicing
                        services, and other small business&ndash;related services and support.</p>
                    <p>By &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;, we mean information about an identifiable
                        individual. That&rsquo;s what this policy is about &ndash; our collection, protection,
                        use, retention, disclosure and other processing of Personal Information and your rights
                        relating to these activities. We also compile certain aggregate data about our users.
                    </p>
                    <p>What is aggregate data? &ldquo;Tim Smith buys a coffee at a coffee shop on Main
                        Street&rdquo; is the Personal Information of Tim Smith, but &ldquo;20% of Peymynt users

                    <h2>Identifying Purposes (#2)</h2>

                    <p>Peymynt collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise manages Personal Information in a
                        variety of ways related to the Services we provide. We&rsquo;ve outlined these below.
                        Your use of the Services determines which information we collect and use. For example,
                        payroll information is optional, unless you&rsquo;d like to use Payroll by Peymynt to
                        run payrolls, at which point we will need to collect payroll information in order to
                        provide you with this service. Similarly, when you create an invoice, your
                        customer&rsquo;s email is optional, but if you&rsquo;d like to us to deliver the invoice
                        by email, this information becomes necessary.</p>
                    <p>Peymynt may collect, use, store, or disclose your Personal Information for the purposes
                        described below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order to provide you with the Services, which includes the following:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We collect information directly from you, but may also collect information from
                                third parties when you connect your Peymynt account to them. These integrations
                                may pull data into or share data out of Peymynt. In some cases, we use a service
                                provider to connect you to a third-party service (<em>e.g.</em>. when you
                                connect to your bank account to pull in transactions).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We may also collect your name and email address from third parties when you sign
                                up and login to our Site using single sign-on (SSO).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you connect your Peymynt account with a third-party service, their terms
                                and policies apply.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To promote or offer you products or services, and to determine your eligibility for
                            new services we may offer from time to time.</li>
                        <li>To provide you with educational materials and guides relevant to the Services you
                            use.</li>
                        <li>To contact you for the purposes of Service updates and system and account
                            notifications.</li>
                        <li>To provide you with support in connection with the Services.</li>
                        <li>To comply with any laws, regulation, court orders, warrants, inquiries, subpoenas or
                            other legal processes or investigations, and to protect ourselves, other
                            individuals, or property from harm.</li>
                        <li>In connection with a prospective or completed merger or sale (including insolvency
                            or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Peymynt or as part of a
                            corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>We will never sell your Personal Information to other companies.</h2>


                    <h2>Consent (#3)</h2>

                    <p>Peymynt takes a consent-based approach to the collection, use and disclosure of
                        Personal Information.</p>

                    <h2>Submitting the Personal Information of others</h2>

                    <p>When you submit the Personal Information of your customers or employees to us, you are
                        responsible for informing such customers and employees about Peymynt, and for obtaining
                        any necessary consent or authority from them.</p>
                    <p>You may also choose to refer someone to our Site. We will send them a single invitation
                        email to the address you provide. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of
                        individuals or businesses with whom you have a relationship and who would want to
                        receive the message.</p>

                    <h2>Closing your Peymynt account</h2>

                    <p>At any time and without penalty, Peymynt users can withdraw their consent to the
                        continued use or disclosure of their Personal Information by closing their Peymynt
                        account. Please ensure you complete the account closure process which includes a
                        confirmation email. Otherwise, your account may not be closed.</p>

                    <h2>Email and communications consent</h2>

                    <p>At any time, you can opt-out of commercial email communications from us by clicking on
                        the unsubscribe link in such emails, or via the Email Preferences settings in your
                        account. Certain non-commercial communications may still be sent to you that are
                        required to provide you with our Services. For example, system notifications, major
                        product changes, changes to our Terms of Use, or other news that we believe will
                        materially affect how you interact with Peymynt.</p>
                    <p>The only way to completely stop all emails from Peymynt is to close your account as
                        outlined above.</p>

                    <h2>Limiting Collection (#4)</h2>

                    <p>Peymynt only collects the Personal Information necessary to provide the Services to
                        you. The Services you use will determine which information Peymynt collects. We&rsquo;ll
                        also provide you the option of sharing additional information to enhance your Peymynt
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>Peymynt may also use third-party services to supplement or enrich our understanding of
                        our customers. This includes cross-referencing information like a name, business name,
                        email address or IP address in third-party databases, and using the information there to
                        improve our understanding of you and your business.</p>
                    <p>Peymynt is not intended for children and we do not knowingly or intentionally collect
                        information about individuals under the age of thirteen (13).</p>
                    <p>Some of the Services allow you to provide access to your Peymynt account to other
                        authorized users, which we call &ldquo;guest collaborators&rdquo;. Guest collaborators
                        have access to information in your Peymynt account, including Personal Information, and
                        may perform various tasks on your behalf. You take full responsibility for any
                        collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by your collaborator(s).
                    </p>
                    <p>To provide access to your account to a guest collaborator, you must provide the
                        collaborator&rsquo;s name and email address. We will send them a single email inviting
                        them to the Site. Peymynt only uses this information to invite your collaborator. Please
                        ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses that you have a
                        relationship with and who would want to receive the message. The guest collaborator may
                        contact us at&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:privacy@peymynt.com"
                                target="_blank">privacy@peymynt.com</a></strong>to request that we remove their
                        name and email address from our database.</p>

                    <h2>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention (#5)</h2>

                    <p>We will use your Personal Information as described in this policy.</p>
                    <p>We will share your Personal Information with third parties only as described in this
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes
                        outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law or
                        regulation. To be clear, that means we&rsquo;ll retain your Personal Information while
                        you have an active account, and afterward if we need to do so to meet our legal
                        obligations. If you choose to close your Peymynt account, we will destroy your Personal
                        Information within 90 days unless we are otherwise obliged to keep it longer.</p>

                    <h2>Accuracy (#6)</h2>

                    <p>Peymynt relies on you to provide us with information that is accurate and complete. We
                        provide you the mechanisms and rely on you to keep your information up to date. You can
                        request updates or corrections of any inaccuracies in your Personal Information at any
                        time by contacting us at the contact information listed in the policy. We will respond
                        to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
                    <h2>Safeguards (#7)</h2>
                    <p>Peymynt uses a combination of reasonable and appropriate safeguards designed to protect
                        your information. These safeguards are administrative controls (things like policies,
                        procedures, and training), technical controls (things like encryption, firewalls, and
                        secure coding frameworks), and physical controls (secured hosting environments).</p>
                    <p>For additional details, please see our&nbsp;<strong>security page</strong>.</p>
                    <p>We ensure that any third party acting on our behalf maintains reasonable and
                        appropriate safeguards in respect of your Personal Information. Additional information
                        about our third parties&rsquo; privacy practices is available upon request.</p>

                    <p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal
                        Information. For instance, never give out your email account information or your
                        password for the Services to third parties. Our team will never request your password or
                        PIN, and we ask that you never post account or credit card numbers to our support
                        channels.</p>
